### **3. System Permissions & Application Behavior**
**3.1 Necessary File Permissions.** The App requires read/write permissions **only within its own designated application file directory and database**. This is strictly necessary for its core functions: creating, reading, updating, and deleting its own configuration files and encrypted database.

**3.2 Scope of Access.** The App is explicitly designed **NOT** to access, read, write, or execute code anywhere on your system outside of its own file structure, unless explicitly granted permission by you for a specific, user-initiated action (e.g., selecting a location for a backup export).

**3.3 No External Execution.** The App does not execute any scripts, programs, or code on your system outside of its own contained processes.
